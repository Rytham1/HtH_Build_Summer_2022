# Why are you interested in this dataset?

Video games are very popular, with millions of users all around the world. It's also a great way kids work with each other. However there are still debates regarding which console is better? and which games are better? By using this research, I will try to identify which console produces more sales, and has a good user count overall. I will also try to see which games are top performing and if things like their release date plays a role in how well they do because we know GTA V is 9 years old and is in the top 5 right now. Using machine learning algorithms I will then try to analyze what influences a game to be a top performing game, is it their release date, their genre, their publisher? Then analyze which games are top performing and why.
